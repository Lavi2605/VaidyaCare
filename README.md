## 🧠 Intelligent Features Explained

### ADR Detection

<img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/pill.png" width="24"/> The system uses a predefined medication database to:
- Detect potential drug-drug interactions
- Identify symptoms that may be related to adverse drug reactions
- Flag dangerous medication combinations

### Symptom Analysis

<img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/stethoscope.png" width="24"/> For each symptom collected, the system:
- Evaluates severity based on patient input
- Considers duration and intensity
- Cross-references with existing conditions
- Suggests possible diagnoses for the physician to consider

### Emergency Rating

<img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/ambulance.png" width="24"/> Appointments are automatically assigned a priority score (0-10) based on:
- Symptom severity
- Known high-risk combinations
- Patient history and risk factors
- Duration of symptoms

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Integration with wearable health devices
- Machine learning for improved symptom analysis
- Voice-to-text for easier data entry
- Mobile application development
- Integration with hospital EHR systems
- Telemedicine features
